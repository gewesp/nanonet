Minimizing 2-dimensional Rosenbrock function for specific starting values.
PASS
Minimizing d-dimensional Rosenbrock function for random starting values.
Calculating distance to actual minimum at (1,...,1).
For d >= 4, this may not be zero, because the function has a second local minimum. Only if the gradient at the minimum is too large, the test fails.
